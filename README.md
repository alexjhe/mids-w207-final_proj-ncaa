Here’s the plan for your final project.
 
(0) Form a working group with 1-4 people. It is strongly suggested that you work with at least one other person so you can divide up the work, but if you have a compelling reason to work alone, that’s ok too.
 
(1) Choose a project on Kaggle. For example:
San Francisco crime classification
Forest cover type prediction
Bike sharing demand
Random acts of pizza
Detect the location of keypoints on the face (difficult)
 
(2) Download the data and figure out how to import it into python/numpy objects so you can process it with SK-Learn. Split the data you get into training and development for running your own experiments. Establish a baseline and submit to Kaggle for verification. For your submission, you should probably train your model on all the data you have. Send your instructor a link to the leaderboard that shows your baseline score. Note that if you are working on a non-active project, the leaderboard will not update to reflect your submission; just email your score and rank to your instructor.
Due Date: 3/13
 
(3) Send an outline to your instructor briefly summarizing the work you’ve done and what you plan to do before the final due date.
Due Date: 4/3
 
(4) Run experiments! Try different models and parameter settings. Engineer new features. Use feature selection techniques. Examine errors and iterate. See how much progress on the leaderboard you can make.
 
(5) Synthesize your work in an ipython notebook. Use the CRISP-DM workflow to structure your document. Target your explanation and analysis to the version of yourself before you started this course. We’d like to make your notebooks public and as useful as possible to people getting started with machine learning. We are more interested in experiments and analysis that make concepts you’ve learned clear than your ranking on the leaderboard (though good performance will make people more interested in reading what you have to say).
 
Try to limit the number of experiments you include in the notebook to just those that improved results or were interesting in some useful way. If you’d like to include extra work, add an appendix at the end. You should include some kind of summary table that shows the relative contribution of each important idea you implemented.
Due Date: Last day of class
 
(6) Your group will be responsible for a ~15 minute presentation in the final live session.
Due Date: Your last live session
