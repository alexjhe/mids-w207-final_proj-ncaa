------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Update features_example with statistics

1. Add columns to RegSeasonDetailedResults:

ALTER TABLE "RegSeasonDetailedResults" ADD "WFGM2" INT;
ALTER TABLE "RegSeasonDetailedResults" ADD "WFGA2" INT;
ALTER TABLE "RegSeasonDetailedResults" ADD "LFGM2" INT;
ALTER TABLE "RegSeasonDetailedResults" ADD "LFGA2" INT;

2. Compute the two point columns:

UPDATE "RegSeasonDetailedResults"
SET "WFGM2" = ("WFGM"-"WFGM3"), "WFGA2" = ("WFGA"-"WFGA3"), "LFGM2" = ("LFGM"-"LFGM3"), "LFGA2" = ("LFGA"-"LFGA3");

3. Create the regular season combined table:

CREATE TABLE "RegSeasonDetailedResultsCombined" (
"Season" INT, "DayNum" INT, "TeamID" INT, "Score" INT, "Win" INT, "Loc" CHAR(1), "NumOT" INT, "FGM" INT, "FGA" INT, "FGM2" INT, "FGA2" INT,
"FGM3" INT, "FGA3" INT, "FTM" INT, "FTA" INT, "OReb" INT, "DReb" INT, "Ast" INT, "TOvr" INT, "Stl" INT, "Blk" INT, "PF" INT);

4. Insert into RegSeasonDetailedResultsCombined

INSERT INTO "RegSeasonDetailedResultsCombined"
SELECT * FROM (
SELECT "Season", "DayNum", "WTeamID" AS "TeamID", "WScore" AS "Score", 1 AS "Win", "WLoc" AS "Loc", "NumOT", "WFGM" AS "FGM", "WFGA" AS "FGA", "WFGM2" AS "FGM2", "WFGA2" AS "FGA2",
"WFGM3" AS "FGM3", "WFGA3" AS "FGA3", "WFTM" AS "FTM", "WFTA" AS "FTA", "WOR" AS "OReb", "WDR" AS "DReb", "WAst" AS "Ast", "WTO" AS "TOvr", "WStl" AS "Stl", "WBlk" AS "Blk", "WPF" AS "PF" FROM "RegSeasonDetailedResults"
UNION
SELECT "Season", "DayNum", "LTeamID" AS "TeamID", "LScore" AS "Score", 0 AS "Win", "WLoc" AS "Loc", "NumOT", "LFGM" AS "FGM", "LFGA" AS "FGA", "LFGM2" AS "FGM2", "LFGA2" AS "FGA2",
"LFGM3" AS "FGM3", "LFGA3" AS "FGA3", "LFTM" AS "FTM", "LFTA" AS "FTA", "LOR" AS "OReb", "LDR" AS "DReb", "LAst" AS "Ast", "LTO" AS "TOvr", "LStl" AS "Stl", "LBlk" AS "Blk", "LPF" AS "PF" FROM "RegSeasonDetailedResults"
) AS Blah;

5. Create a view vSeasonStatistics:

CREATE VIEW "vSeasonStatistics" AS
SELECT R."Season",
		R."TeamID",
		AVG(COALESCE("FGM2"::float/NULLIF("FGA2",0),0)) AS "TwoPointPct",
		AVG(COALESCE("FGM3"::float/NULLIF("FGA3",0),0)) AS "ThreePointPct",
		AVG(COALESCE("FTM"::float/NULLIF("FTA",0),0)) AS "FreeThrowPct",
		AVG("OReb") AS "OffensiveRebounds",
		AVG("DReb") AS "DefensiveRebounds"
FROM "RegSeasonDetailedResultsCombined" R
GROUP BY R."Season", R."TeamID"
ORDER BY R."Season" ASC;

6. Add columns to features_example:

ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "TwoPointPct_Team" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "ThreePointPct_Team" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "FreeThrowPct_Team" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "OffensiveRebounds_Team" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "DefensiveRebounds_Team" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "TwoPointPct_Opponent" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "ThreePointPct_Opponent" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "FreeThrowPct_Opponent" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "OffensiveRebounds_Opponent" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "DefensiveRebounds_Opponent" FLOAT;

7. Update the columns in the features_example from vSeasonStatistics:

UPDATE "features_example" F
SET "TwoPointPct_Team"=SS."TwoPointPct",
	"ThreePointPct_Team"=SS."ThreePointPct",
	"FreeThrowPct_Team"=SS."FreeThrowPct",
	"OffensiveRebounds_Team"=SS."OffensiveRebounds",
	"DefensiveRebounds_Team"=SS."DefensiveRebounds"
FROM "vSeasonStatistics" SS
WHERE (F."Season" = SS."Season") AND (F."Team" = SS."TeamID");

UPDATE "features_example" F
SET "TwoPointPct_Opponent"=SS."TwoPointPct",
	"ThreePointPct_Opponent"=SS."ThreePointPct",
	"FreeThrowPct_Opponent"=SS."FreeThrowPct",
	"OffensiveRebounds_Opponent"=SS."OffensiveRebounds",
	"DefensiveRebounds_Opponent"=SS."DefensiveRebounds"
FROM "vSeasonStatistics" SS
WHERE (F."Season" = SS."Season") AND (F."Team" = SS."TeamID");

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add rankings to features_example table (takes a long time to run)

1. Create DailyRanking table:

CREATE TABLE "DailyRanking" AS
SELECT M."Season", M."TeamID", M."RankingDayNum" AS "DayNum", AVG(M."OrdinalRank") AS "AvgRank"
FROM "MasseyOrdinals" M
GROUP BY M."Season", M."TeamID", M."RankingDayNum"
ORDER BY M."Season", M."TeamID", M."RankingDayNum";

2. Create function:

CREATE FUNCTION GetRankForTeamSeasonDay(TeamIDToFind INT, SeasonToFind INT, DayNumToFind INT) RETURNS FLOAT AS $$
DECLARE
	DayFound INT;
    AvgRankFound FLOAT;
BEGIN
    SELECT MAX("RankingDayNum") INTO DayFound
    FROM "MasseyOrdinals"
    WHERE ("Season"=SeasonToFind) AND ("TeamID"=TeamIDToFind) AND ("RankingDayNum" <= DayNumToFind);

    IF DayFound IS NULL THEN
        SELECT MIN("RankingDayNum") INTO DayFound
        FROM "MasseyOrdinals"
        WHERE ("Season"=SeasonToFind) AND ("TeamID"=TeamIDToFind);
    END IF;

    SELECT "AvgRank" INTO AvgRankFound
    FROM "DailyRanking"
    WHERE ("Season"=SeasonToFind) AND ("TeamID"=TeamIDToFind) AND ("DayNum"=DayFound);

    RETURN AvgRankFound;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

3. Add columns to features_example_temp:

ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "Ranking_Team" FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE "features_example_temp" ADD "Ranking_Opponent" FLOAT;

4. 

UPDATE "features_example_temp" F
SET
    "Ranking_Team"=GetRankForTeamSeasonDay(F."Season", F."Team", F."DayNum"),
    "Ranking_Opponent"=GetRankForTeamSeasonDay(F."Season", F."Opponent", F."DayNum")
FROM "features_example_temp";

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add stage 1 and 2 matchup files for testing

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Stage1Matchup" (
  "Season" INT,
  "Team1" INT,
  "Team2" INT
)
;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Stage2Matchup" (
  "Season" INT,
  "Team1" INT,
  "Team2" INT
)
;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
